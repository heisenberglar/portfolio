# Svelte Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio project built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and plain old CSS. Made to be simple but responsive.

## Running locally

First off, make sure you're running Node with a version of 16.14 or above to run SvelteKit. Then run the following in the project directory to start a dev server:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start development mode and open in browser
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create your production version of this app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Live version

You can view the the live version of my portfolio at [litang.dev](https://litang.dev).
